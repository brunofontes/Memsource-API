# PHP Memsource API

I am creating this Memsource API as a way to learn how to deal with one and to use with my next projects. I will not create the fully functional API here, but feel free to send a pull request if it were interesting for you.

There are other Memsource API repositories on GibHub that appears to be fully functional if you need it.

## Installing

Install it with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

1. Create a `composer.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/brunofontes/Memsource-API"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "brunofontes/memsource-api": "*"
    }
}
```

2. Run `php composer.phar install`
3. Add the following line on your main .php file:

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

## Using

This repository returns a JSON string for almost any command. 
If you are not sure how to use it, just convert it to an object
or an array as follows:

```php
$myObject = json_decode($response);
$myArray = json_decode($response, true);
```

### Create an instance

```php
$memsource = new \BrunoFontes\Memsource();
```

- If you have already an access token, just include it:

```php
$memsource = new \BrunoFontes\Memsource($token);
```

### Basic (only for non-experienced devs)


```php


### Getting an Access Token

To be able to use the Memsource API, you need an **access token**, but to get it, you need to:

#### Register as a developer on Memsource website

So you will receive your:
    - *client id*
    - *client secret*

#### Get an Authorization Code

```php
$url = $memsource->oauth()->getAuthorizationCodeUrl($cliend_id, $callback_uri);
```

Redirect your browser to this returned `$url` so the user can login via *oauth*. 

The `$callback_uri` will be called by **Memsource** with a `$_GET['code']` that contains your Authorization Code, which you can use to...

#### Get an Access Token

```php
$authCode = $_GET['code'];
$token = $memsource->oauth()->getAccessToken($authCode, $client_id, $client_secret, $callback_uri);
```

Safely store this `$token` with the related user data and use it on any 

### Project
#### Project list

To list all projects...

```php
$projectList = $memsource->project()->listProjects;
```

To use filters, add the API filter as parÃ¢meter:
```php
$projectList = $memsource->project()->listProjects(['name' => 'Project X']);
```

### Job

### List Jobs

Only projectUid is essencial:
```php
$memsource->jobs()->listJobs($projectUid, ['count' => true, 'filename' => 'my_file.html']);
```
